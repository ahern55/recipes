This is a super simple recipe management app. 

I created this app as a minimum viable product of sorts. I realized that my recipes were disorganized in my notes app, and I wanted a uniform way to store my recipes. So the app was mostly designed for my own use (and to learn about mobile development, of course ðŸ˜‰).

I used .NET with Xamarin.Forms to build the native apps for iOS and Android with one tooling.

I currently use a C# SQLite package to store on the devices' local hard drives, but eventually I'd like to host some central database server. I'd probably write the API in node.js

In creating this, I learned a lot about native app development. I also learned the workflow for publishing an app to both Apple's and Google's app stores!
